# Columnar Structure Array

## Abstract

An **array of structure (AoS)** is not cache-friendly nor SIMD friendly. One of its replacement is **structure of array (SoA)**.
However, AoS is so straightforward for programmers to code in, and easy to maintain. It is also fundamental for OOP.

This project designs a structure helper for programmers to use SoA, but to code as in AoS.

## Objective
- C++ base-level API
  
  - Fundamental Types support
  - Custom type support, possibly at declaration phase
  - Wrapper for STL containers *(optional)*
  - Automatic type extension by type structure discovery, with parsers *(optional)*

- Python API
  
  - A fixed-type list wrapper for PyObject-s
  - NumPy- & Pandas- friendly *(optional)*

- Ensure memory layout properties hold
  
  We should satisfy [key features of columnar format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#:~:text=The%20columnar%20format%20has,access%20in%20shared%20memory),
  
  - Data adjacency for sequential access of same member
  - Constant-time random access
  - SIMD and vectorization friendly
  - Relocatable with zero-copy access

  And additionally,

  - Compile-time address resolution
    
    Hopefully with same instructions as AoS, with light object reference handle (not too much than a pointer).
    
  - Optimizations for cache locality, e.g. padding *(optional)*
